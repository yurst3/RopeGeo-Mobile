        The Roman numerals in an ACA rating indicate approximately how long the
        entire canyon trip generally takes a typical group. Actual time can vary
        substantially; this is a guideline for distinguishing long canyons from
        short ones. Times assume a small (4–6 person) team of experienced, fit
        adults.
