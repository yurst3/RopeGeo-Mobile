        The ACA rating system uses &quot;additional risk&quot; to denote elevated risk factors above the norm.
        &quot;Effective risk&quot; takes into account the technical rating
        and additional risk rating to reflect the true expected risk of a route.
        Each technical rating has a minimum effective risk which the ACA additional risk rating can increase.
